# MSIPatches

## About
The "C:\Windows\Installer" can often grow very large in size due to applications such as Microsoft Office being regularly patched. Superseded patches get left behind leaving them in an orphaned state. The MSIPatches module can detect and move the orphaned patches freeing up valuable disk space.  
This module requires the the [MSI](https://github.com/heaths/psmsi) module by [Heath Stewart](https://github.com/heaths). Installation instructions are in the next section


**MSIPactches** functions
	
**Get-MsiPatches.ps1**
* Lists all msp files in `$env:SystemRoot\Installer\`
* Calculates their total size
* Gets installed patches and size
* Gets orphaned patches and size

**Get-OrphanedPatches.ps1**
* Lists all orphaned patches in `$env:SystemRoot\Installer\`
* Outputs the objects as `[System.IO.FileInfo]` which can be piped to the next functions.

**Move-OrphanedPatches.ps1**
* Moves all orphaned patches in `$env:SystemRoot\Installer\` to a specified location.

**Restore-OrphanedPatches.ps1**
* Restores all previously backed up orphaned patches to `$env:SystemRoot\Installer\`
