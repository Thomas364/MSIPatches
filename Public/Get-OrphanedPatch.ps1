function Get-OrphanedPatch {
    <# 
    .SYNOPSIS 
        Scans the "C:\Windows\Installer" directory for all orpaned msp files.
    .DESCRIPTION 
        Office installations can leave behind a large amount of orphaned patches which can take up many GBs of disk space.
        Using the "Get-MSIPatchInfo" cmdlet from the "MSI" module we can determine which msp files are currently installed.
        From there we can calculate the amount and size of the orpaned msp files.

        This can be run on it's own to list the orphaned patches, or piped to Move-OrphanedPatches or Remove-OrphanedPatches.
    .EXAMPLE 
        Get-OrphanedPatch
        
        Simply lists orphaned msp files in "C:\Windows\Installer"
    .EXAMPLE 
        Get-OrphanedPatch | Move-OrphanedPatch -Destination <String>
        
        If you want to free up space I recommend moving the orphaned msp files to another location so they can easily be
        restored. Supports the "-Whatif" and "Verbose" paramters.
    .EXAMPLE
        Get-OrphanedPatch | Remove-Item

        This will permanently delete the orphaned msp files from "C:\Windows\Installer". Supports the "-Whatif" and 
        "Verbose" paramters.
